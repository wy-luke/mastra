# Docs Expert

A research assistant that answers questions about libraries, APIs, and documentation by searching the live web and citing its sources. Built on Mastra with the OpenAI `web_search` provider tool, routed through the Mastra Gateway.

## Why we built this

Models drift out of date the moment they're trained. Docs and APIs don't. This template shows how to wire a Mastra agent that:

- Uses provider-native web search (`openai.tools.webSearch()`) — no extra search API key needed when routed through the Mastra Gateway.
- Persists observability and observational memory to Turso (libSQL) using `@mastra/libsql`.
- Demonstrates the Mastra Gateway pattern: one `MASTRA_GATEWAY_API_KEY` instead of per-provider keys.

## Demo

This demo runs in Mastra Studio, but you can connect this agent to your React, Next.js, or Vue app using the [Mastra Client SDK](https://mastra.ai/docs/server/mastra-client) or agentic UI libraries like [AI SDK UI](https://mastra.ai/guides/build-your-ui/ai-sdk-ui), [CopilotKit](https://mastra.ai/guides/build-your-ui/copilotkit), or [Assistant UI](https://mastra.ai/guides/build-your-ui/assistant-ui).

## Prerequisites

- A [Mastra Gateway API key](https://mastra.ai/docs/models/gateways/mastra) — proxies to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc. behind a single key.
- A [Turso](https://turso.tech) database (URL + auth token) for storage. A free dev tier is fine; in-memory libSQL works too if you swap the URL to `:memory:`.

## Quickstart 🚀

1. **Clone the template**
   - Run `npx create-mastra@latest --template docs-expert` to scaffold the project locally.
2. **Add your API keys**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys.
3. **Start the dev server**
   - Run `npm run dev` and open [localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) to try it out.

Ask things like:

- "What's the current API for `openai.tools.webSearch()` in `@ai-sdk/openai`?"
- "Compare pgvector HNSW vs IVFFlat indexes for cosine similarity."
- "What changed in Node 22 LTS vs 20 LTS?"

## Making it yours

- **Swap the model.** Any Mastra Gateway model id works — try `mastra/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` or `mastra/google/gemini-2.5-flash`. Web search continues to work because Anthropic and Google ship their own provider-native search tools (`anthropic.tools.webSearch_20250305`, `google.tools.googleSearch`).
- **Tighten the system prompt.** Constrain the agent to a single docs domain (e.g. "only answer about Mastra") and require it to refuse unrelated questions.
- **Add structured output.** Set `structuredOutput` on the agent or call `generate({ output: z.object({ answer: z.string(), sources: z.array(...) }) })` to force JSON with citations.
- **Persist conversations.** This template already wires Memory + Turso, so threads survive restarts.

## About Mastra templates

[Mastra templates](https://mastra.ai/templates) are ready-to-use projects that show off what you can build — clone one, poke around, and make it yours. They live in the [Mastra monorepo](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) and are automatically synced to standalone repositories for easier cloning.
